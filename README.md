# Dot Matrix
Off-school project. This project is still in progress and consists of two parts. The first, that is already done, consists of a dot matrix program that when a character is drawn it is written directly in code and added to the code. It contains a finished GUI made in SWING as shown by the following screeshot.

The second is unfinished and is an informative matrix board made for trains and subway systems.
